		Savesave installation

Before install SaveSave, the following requirements need to be met

	Kconfiglib (install via pip, tested with version 14.1)

	CMake => 3.21

	Clang && Clang++ (tested with version 18.1)

	Ninja build (tested with version 1.12)

	Windows 11 SDK

	MSVC (tested with version v143)

Normally you can just do â€˜winbuild.ps1â€™, and that will build the program under
build/ directory. If you want to do a config, you can do

	> menuconfig
	# and run winbuild.ps1 again to build the program

If you're willing to clean up build configs (and you better do this to avoid
any inconsistent config after running make menuconfig), you just delete the
build directories

	> rm build
	> rm include/generated
